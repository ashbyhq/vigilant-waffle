quote_text: Rather impressed with Ashby from demos - any TA folks want to
  comment/DM me your experience with it? I already know what I don't like about
  [Legacy ATS] (chaotic reporting and loopholes required to do basic functions)
  and [Legacy ATS] (lack of customization and source tracking) -- Ashby appears
  to solve for all of that, and more... just curious on others' experience!
  Ready for the hot gossip.
