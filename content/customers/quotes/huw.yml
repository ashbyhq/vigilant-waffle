quote_text: The biggest reason I recommend Ashby is because of how much you can
  automate activities within different stages. When you first set up a new
  vacancy on Ashby, you can set up all the different things that you want to be
  automated between each step of the process. It saves you countless hours of
  admin time throughout the process.
