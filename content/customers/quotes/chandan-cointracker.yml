quote_text: We just switched from <i>Legacy ATS</i>. Long story short - Ashby is
  amazing. They are taking an end-to-end approach to recruiting that is
  startup-friendly. They combine the functionality of sourcing, outreach,
  applicant tracking, analytics (much better than <i>Legacy ATS</i>), scheduling
  automation and more. Best of all they have a strong & responsive support team,
  they make on-boarding super easy. I wish Ashby had been around when we
  launched so we could have just started with them from the beginning.
