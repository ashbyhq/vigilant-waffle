  - slug: why_demo
    question: Why take a demo?
    answer: Your hiring processes and workflows are unique and critical to your
      entire team’s efficiency. We therefore feel it is important to invest a
      short amount of time upfront to ensure Ashby is the right fit to set you
      up for success. The call will quickly cover your hiring goals, give you a
      brief demo of the relevant product features and workflows, and allow you
      to assess whether we have the right solution. We are committed to
      transparent pricing so the above price will not change during the sales
      process.
    testimonial: Daniel Grayson, VP of Talent at Astronomer, recently told us that
      “We've been getting fantastic feedback from our recruiting team and hiring
      managers. Once Ashby is set up it removes a TON of friction from the
      experience for both candidates and managers.“
  - slug: pricing_work
    question: How does pricing work for startups?
    answer: Our startup pricing model is based on the size of your organization at
      that point of purchase, not on a seat or talent team basis. Startup plans
      also include 200 email lookups per month, and more can be purchased.
      Pricing is reassessed annually. The aim is to provide affordable usage so
      you can put the right tooling for scale in early. Once your organization
      exceeds 100 full-time employees we move to a custom pricing model so that
      we can consider the complexities of your business.
  - slug: charge_module
    question: Does Ashby charge for each module?
    answer: No. With our All-in-One solution, it’s one price for the entire platform
      across ATS, Sourcing, CRM, Scheduling, and Analytics.
    testimonial: Camilla Lever, Director of People at Coder, shared that she “found
      Ashby to be the missing link between sourcing and staying on top of active
      candidates. I wanted to consolidate my tools, and this was a great way for
      me to combine Sourcing and CRM with an ATS.“ <a

      excellence and implementation, we have a customer success team that can
      support you.
    testimonial: "Chandon Lohdan, Hiring at CoinTracker, was kind enough to say
      about Ashby: “Best of all they have a strong & responsive support team,
      they make on-boarding super easy. I wish Ashby had been around when we
      launched so we could have just started with them from the beginning.“"
  - slug: charge_impl
